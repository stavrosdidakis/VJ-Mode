# VJ Mode 1.5

## Description

**VJ Mode** is a software application that has been developed to assist artists and visualists creating and automating content for **audiovisual performances**. The program has a vast amount of tools and features implemented to easily and efficiently control all necessary processes needed for a complete show. The user may select the working material needed (videos, generated visuals, effects) utilising an intuitive storage and selection of files and folders, and set selections and transition modes between events and even configure automatic settings for their interpolations.

**VJ Mode** includes an audio analysis engine that can control parameters instantly linked to the visual processing, or utilise a range of control methods available (i.e. time-based, random, and so on). Pre-installed VFX units allow the user to achieve impressive visual outcomes, with the opportunity to upgrade the current effects database (FreeFrame). Other basic features include a real-time audio visualiser that displays a number of different visual-styled waveforms, multiscreen support with up to four screens, total control of the output screens (size, position, keystone, etc), and communication with internal and external hardware and software devices with MIDI, OSC, and TouchOSC protocols.
